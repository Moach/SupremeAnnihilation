# SupremeAnnihilation
A Mod for a Mod of the legendary Total Annihilation based on the SpringRTS engine. Major balance changes to improve the merits of tactics over speed management



Note:  Only the relevant altered files are tracked here - installation should be performed as follows:

 - download Balanced Annihilation (see SpringRTS)
 
 - clone this repo
 
 - copy your BA .sdz file under Spring/Games and rename it to 'Supreme Annihilation' or some such
 
 - shove everything in this repo's "Games" folder into that new .sdz file (7-zip can open it like any archive) - overwrite as needed
 
 - chuck everything from "LuaUI" into the same named folder in your Spring root


it should work... it might not, but ideally it should.



Mod Concept:

I'll write this properly later... basically what I've done is rework unit specs to favor strategic thinking and authentic use of tactics over brute-force, APM-greedy speed management (to which most RTS games usually reduce to when played competitively)

this is most totally not all done, and is a work in progress. By reading this I assume you're interested in the idea, so please bear with me as we go along (yes, I have a bear with me, so everyone must be patient, since the bear is with ME, right? (I guess that's what the expression means (which implies I get to abuse your patience with things like multiple nested parentheses)))


Mind the heavily armed robots inside.
